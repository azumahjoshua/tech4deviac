# Scenario-Based
## 19. You are tasked with setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices architecture using Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins. Outline the steps you would take and the tools you would use at each stage.

Design an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying microservices on `Kubernetes`, leveraging `Terraform` for infrastructure provisioning and `Jenkins` for continuous integration and delivery.

1. Infrastructure Provisioning

    **Tools:** Terraform, Cloud Provider eg. AWS
    - Write Terraform configuration files to provision cloud resources, including:
        - Kubernetes cluster
        - Networking components (VPCs, subnets, security groups, load balancers)
        - IAM roles and policies for secure access
        - Additional services such as managed databases, storage buckets, or secret managers
    - Integrate Terraform execution into the pipeline:
        - Initialize Terraform (`terraform init`)
        - Plan infrastructure changes (`terraform plan`)
        - Apply infrastructure (`terraform apply`)

2. Cluster Configuration
    
    **Tools:** kubectl, Helm
    - Configure the Kubernetes cluster post-provisioning:
        - Install Ingress controllers (e.g., NGINX Ingress)
        - Deploy monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd)
        - Set up the Kubernetes Metrics Server for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
    - Prepare Helm charts for microservices deployments.
    - Automate deployments using Helm through Jenkins pipelines.

3. Source Code Management

    **Tools:** GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
    - Host microservices source code in a version control system.
    - Each repository should include:
        - A Dockerfile for containerization
        - A Helm chart or standardized deployment configuration
    - Implement branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow) and configure webhooks to trigger Jenkins pipelines on code commits or pull requests.

4.  Continuous Integration (CI) – Build and Test Stage

    **Tools:** Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube (optional for code quality analysis)
    - Jenkins pipeline stages:
        - Checkout code from the repository.
        - Execute unit and integration tests.
        - Perform static code analysis using tools like SonarQube.
        - Build Docker images for each microservice.
        - Tag images with build identifiers (e.g., commit SHA or version numbers).
        - Push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

5. Continuous Deployment (CD) – Deploy and Release Stage

    **Tools:** Jenkins, Helm, kubectl
    - Jenkins pipeline stages:
        - Pull and prepare Helm charts for deployment.
        - Update Helm values dynamically (e.g., inject new Docker image tags).
        - Deploy updated microservices to Kubernetes using `helm upgrade --install`.
        - Execute post-deployment validation such as smoke tests and readiness checks.

6. Environment Management

    **Tools:** Kubernetes Namespaces, Helm
    - Separate development, staging, and production environments using Kubernetes namespaces.
    - Maintain environment-specific configuration through Helm value overrides.
    - Implement automated promotion pipelines (e.g., promote from staging to production after approval).

7. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

    **Tools:** Jenkins Plugins (Docker Pipeline, Kubernetes CLI, GitHub Integration, Terraform Plugin)
    - Set up multibranch Jenkins pipelines to automatically build and deploy based on Git branch activity.
    - Configure Git webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs on code changes.
    - Secure Jenkins with appropriate access control and integrate with credential managers for secrets management.

8. Security and Best Practices

    - Store sensitive information using Kubernetes Secrets or managed secret services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
    - Apply Kubernetes RBAC policies to limit access by service accounts and users.
    - Implement secure communication between microservices (e.g., mTLS, network policies).
    - Enable Helm rollback features to automatically revert in case of failed deployments.
    - Monitor pipeline health and deployments through logging and alerting tools.
